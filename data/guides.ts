    metaDescription: 'Complete guide to using the RSI indicator for crypto trading. Learn how to read RSI signals and avoid common mistakes.',
    definition: 'The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes. It ranges from 0 to 100 and helps traders identify when an asset is overbought (typically above 70) or oversold (typically below 30).',
    howItWorks: 'RSI calculates the average of gains and losses over a specified period (usually 14 periods). When the RSI is above 70, it suggests the asset may be overbought and could reverse downward. When below 30, it suggests the asset may be oversold and could reverse upward.',
    howToRead: 'On a crypto chart, RSI appears as a line below the price chart. Look for RSI crossing above 70 (overbought signal) or below 30 (oversold signal). Divergences between price and RSI can also signal potential reversals. For example, if Bitcoin price makes a new high but RSI makes a lower high, it may indicate weakening momentum.',
    example: 'Bitcoin is trading at $50,000 and RSI reaches 75. This suggests Bitcoin is overbought. A trader might wait for RSI to drop below 70 before considering a short position, or look for confirmation from other indicators before entering a trade.',
    pros: [
      'Easy to understand and widely available on all trading platforms',
      'Works well in ranging markets to identify entry and exit points',
      'Can help identify potential trend reversals early',
      'No complex calculations needed - most platforms calculate it automatically',
    ],
    cons: [
      'Can give false signals in strong trending markets (RSI can stay overbought/oversold for extended periods)',
      'Not reliable as a standalone indicator - should be used with other analysis',
      'Default 14-period setting may not work for all timeframes or assets',
      'Can lag behind price action in fast-moving markets',
    ],
    commonMistakes: [
      'Trading solely based on RSI without considering price action or other indicators',
      'Ignoring the overall trend - RSI signals are more reliable when aligned with the trend',
      'Using the same RSI settings for all cryptocurrencies and timeframes',
      'Entering trades immediately when RSI crosses 70 or 30 without waiting for confirmation',
      'Not considering that RSI can remain in extreme zones during strong trends',

    metaTitle: 'MACD Indicator Guide for Crypto Traders | Cryptopedia',
    metaDescription: 'Complete guide to using MACD for crypto trading. Learn how to read MACD crossovers and divergences.',
    definition: 'MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of an asset\'s price. It consists of the MACD line, signal line, and histogram.',
    howItWorks: 'MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The signal line is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generates a bullish signal. When it crosses below, it generates a bearish signal.',
    howToRead: 'On a crypto chart, MACD appears as two lines and a histogram. A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. A bearish crossover occurs when it crosses below. The histogram shows the distance between the two lines - positive values indicate bullish momentum, negative values indicate bearish momentum.',
    example: 'Ethereum\'s MACD line crosses above the signal line while both are below zero. This is a bullish signal suggesting potential upward momentum. A trader might enter a long position after this crossover, especially if confirmed by price action breaking above a key resistance level.',
    pros: [
      'Excellent for identifying trend changes and momentum shifts',
      'Works across different timeframes from minutes to daily charts',
      'Provides clear buy and sell signals through crossovers',
      'Histogram helps visualize momentum strength',
    ],
    cons: [
      'Can lag behind price action, especially in choppy markets',
      'May give false signals in sideways or ranging markets',
      'Requires understanding of multiple components (MACD line, signal line, histogram)',
      'Not ideal for very short-term trading due to lag',
    ],
    commonMistakes: [
      'Trading every MACD crossover without considering the overall market context',
      'Ignoring the histogram - it provides valuable momentum information',
      'Not waiting for confirmation from price action or other indicators',
      'Using MACD in isolation without considering support/resistance levels',
      'Confusing MACD crossovers with divergences - both are important signals',

    metaTitle: 'Doji Candlestick Pattern Guide for Crypto Traders | Cryptopedia',
    metaDescription: 'Complete guide to trading Doji patterns in crypto. Learn when Doji signals reversals and how to use them effectively.',
    definition: 'A Doji is a candlestick pattern where the opening and closing prices are nearly equal, creating a cross-like shape. It indicates market indecision and potential reversal, especially after a strong trend.',
    howItWorks: 'A Doji forms when buyers and sellers are in equilibrium - neither side can push the price significantly. The small body (difference between open and close) with long wicks shows that while there was price movement during the period, the market closed near where it opened.',
    howToRead: 'On a crypto chart, a Doji appears as a small horizontal line (body) with wicks extending above and below. After an uptrend, a Doji at the top suggests buyers are losing control. After a downtrend, a Doji at the bottom suggests sellers are losing control. The longer the wicks, the stronger the indecision signal.',
    example: 'Bitcoin has been in an uptrend for several days, reaching $52,000. A Doji forms at this level with long upper and lower wicks. This suggests indecision and potential reversal. A trader might wait for the next candle to confirm - if it closes below the Doji, it confirms a bearish reversal.',
    pros: [
      'Easy to spot on charts - visually distinctive pattern',
      'Works on all timeframes from 1-minute to daily charts',
      'Provides early warning of potential trend reversals',
      'No calculations needed - pure price action analysis',
    ],
    cons: [
      'Not all Doji patterns lead to reversals - many are false signals',
      'Requires confirmation from subsequent candles or other indicators',
      'Can be subjective - what constitutes "nearly equal" open/close varies',
      'Less reliable in choppy or sideways markets',
    ],
    commonMistakes: [
      'Trading immediately when seeing a Doji without waiting for confirmation',
      'Ignoring the context - Doji after a strong trend is more significant than in a ranging market',
      'Not considering the length of wicks - longer wicks indicate stronger indecision',
      'Trading Doji in isolation without considering support/resistance levels',
      'Confusing Doji with other small-body patterns like spinning tops',

    metaDescription: 'Complete guide to using stop-loss orders in crypto trading. Learn how to set stops and protect your capital.',
    definition: 'A stop-loss order is a risk management tool that automatically closes a position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting potential losses. It\'s an essential tool for protecting capital in volatile crypto markets.',
    howItWorks: 'When you place a stop-loss order, you set a price level at which your position will be automatically closed. For a long position, the stop-loss is set below the entry price. For a short position, it\'s set above the entry price. If the market moves against you and reaches this level, the exchange automatically executes the order.',
    howToRead: 'On a crypto exchange, you can set stop-loss orders when opening a position or modify existing positions. The stop-loss appears as a line on your chart showing where your position will close. Most exchanges allow you to set stop-loss as a percentage (e.g., 5% below entry) or a fixed price level.',
    example: 'You buy Ethereum at $3,000 and set a stop-loss at $2,850 (5% below entry). If Ethereum drops to $2,850, your position automatically closes, limiting your loss to $150 per ETH. This protects you from larger losses if the market continues to decline.',
    pros: [
      'Automatically limits losses without requiring constant monitoring',

      'Essential for risk management and capital preservation',
      'Works 24/7 even when you\'re not watching the markets',

    metaDescription: 'Learn what Bitcoin is, how it works, and how to get started. Essential guide for crypto beginners in Hong Kong.',
    definition: 'Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network without a central authority. Created in 2009, it was the first cryptocurrency and remains the largest by market capitalization.',
    howItWorks: 'Bitcoin uses blockchain technology - a distributed ledger that records all transactions. Miners validate transactions by solving complex mathematical problems and are rewarded with new Bitcoins. Transactions are verified by the network and cannot be reversed, making Bitcoin secure and transparent.',
    howToRead: 'Bitcoin\'s price is displayed on exchanges and trading platforms. You can see the current price, 24-hour change, trading volume, and market cap. Price charts show historical data, and you can view Bitcoin\'s performance over different timeframes (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, etc.).',
    example: 'You want to buy Bitcoin. You create an account on a licensed Hong Kong exchange, complete KYC verification, deposit HKD, and purchase Bitcoin. The Bitcoin is stored in your exchange wallet. For better security, you might transfer it to a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor.',

    definition: 'A crypto wallet is a digital tool that stores your private keys, allowing you to send, receive, and manage cryptocurrencies. Wallets don\'t actually store coins - they store the keys that give you access to your coins on the blockchain.',
    howItWorks: 'Wallets generate a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key (your wallet address, like a bank account number) and a private key (like a password, must be kept secret). The public key allows others to send you crypto, while the private key allows you to access and send your crypto. Different wallet types offer different levels of security and convenience.',
    howToRead: 'When choosing a wallet, you\'ll see options like hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor), software wallets (Exodus, MetaMask), mobile wallets (Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet), and exchange wallets. Each has different features: hardware wallets are most secure but less convenient, while exchange wallets are convenient but less secure.',
    example: 'You buy Bitcoin on a Hong Kong exchange. Initially, it\'s stored in the exchange\'s wallet. For better security, you transfer it to a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano X. You connect the device, install the Bitcoin app, generate a recovery phrase (12-24 words), and transfer your Bitcoin. Now your private keys are stored offline, making it much more secure.',
